RefleXion is developing the SCINTIX™ biology-guided radiotherapy* machine that is the first to utilize the cancer’s biology itself to control radiation delivery, even in tumors that are moving.

Currently, the RefleXion X1 machine is cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the delivery of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT).
